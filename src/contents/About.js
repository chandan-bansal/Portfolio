            <p>I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of
                Information and Technology, Una. Being a beginner I started web development in college years and developed various
                personal projects to enhance my knowledge. I have keen interest in Data Science as well. I love to watch the results 
                when these two domains merge.
